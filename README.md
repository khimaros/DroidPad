### Key Features:
1. **Drag-and-Drop Control Pad Creation**  
   Design your control pads by dragging and dropping components like buttons, sliders, switches, Joystick and D-PAD.  

2. **Multi-Protocol Support and Seamless Server Connections**  
Easily configure your control pad to support network protocols such as **Bluetooth LE, WebSocket (Client/Server), MQTT, TCP, and UDP**. Once connected, you can interact with the control pad’s components—including **buttons, sliders, switches, joysticks, and D-PADs**—to send real-time commands directly to the connected server or BLE client, where these commands can be processed.

   A control pad can also be attached to a **MIDI** device, in which case each component sends MIDI messages instead of JSON or CSV. See [MIDI](#midi).

3. **Switch Connection Type Anytime**  
   You can change the connection type of a control pad at any time without creating a duplicate for a different connection.

4. **Update UI From your Script**  
   You can change the state of SWITCH,SLIDER,LED and GAUGE from your script    
   
   
## Supported Components
1. Switch
2. Button
3. Slider
4. DPAD
5. Joystick
6. Steering Wheel
7. LED
8. GAUGE
9. LOG
10. Accelerometer and Gyroscope (If supported by the device)

## How It Works (4 steps) 

### **Step 1: Create a Control Pad**  
Start by creating a new control pad. Provide a unique name to identify your control pad.

   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0bb34e6-d2ab-4245-ada9-19a8a030ebdc" width="240" height="426" />
   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2ff23e0-cf4c-4c97-820f-69ec1efa935b" width="240" height="426" />

### **Step 2: Design Your Control Pad**  
After creating the control pad, click on the **Build** icon and use the drag-and-drop interface to add components like switches, buttons, and sliders etc.
   
   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d501e0db-1c4e-426c-b71c-506b6ab497c5" width="240" height="426" />

## **Reading Interactions**  
When users interact with the control pad, JSON-formatted or CSV messages are generated based on the type of component used. 
These string messages enable receivers to understand and process interactions sent from the control pad. Below are the formats and details for each interaction:  

---

### **SWITCH**  
Toggling a switch generates the following JSON:  
```json
{
  "id": "the id you specified",
  "type": "SWITCH",
  "state": true
}
```
For **Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth LE** connections, toggling a switch generates a `CSV` message in the format: `<id>,SWITCH,<state>`.

- The `state` field indicates whether the switch is **on** (`true`) or **off** (`false`).  

---

### **BUTTON**  
Pressing or releasing a button generates this JSON:  
```json
{
  "id": "the id you specified",
  "type": "BUTTON",
  "state": "PRESS"
}
```
For **Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth LE** connections, pressing or releasing a button generates a `CSV` message in the format: `<id>,BUTTON,<state>`.

- The `state` field can have following values:  
  - **"PRESS"**: When the button is being pressed (finger on the button).  
  - **"RELEASE"**: When the button is released (finger lifted off after pressing).
  - **"CLICK"**: Indicates tap gesture   

---

### **DPAD (Directional Pad)**  
Pressing or releasing a button on DPAD generates this JSON:  
```json
{
  "id": "the id you specified",
  "type": "DPAD",
  "button": "RIGHT",
  "state": "CLICK"
}
```
For **Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth LE** connections, pressing or releasing a button on DPAD generates a `CSV` message in the format: `<id>,DPAD,<button>,<state>`.

- The `state` field can have following values:  
  - **"PRESS"**: When the button is being pressed (finger on the button).  
  - **"RELEASE"**: When the button is released (finger lifted off after pressing).
  - **"CLICK"**: Indicates tap gesture
- The `button` field can be **"LEFT"**,**"RIGHT"**,**"UP"** or **"DOWN"**    

---
### **STEERING WHEEL**
Rotating a steering wheel generates this JSON:
```json
{
  "id": "your id",
  "type": "STEERING_WHEEL",
  "angle": 45.233445
}
```
For **Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth LE** connections the `CSV` is `<id>,STEERING_WHEEL,<angle>`

 - where `angle` is rotation angle of the steering wheel in degrees
   - **Positive values** indicate clockwise rotation
   - **Negative values** indicate counter-clockwise (anti-clockwise) rotation 

   

---

### **JOYSTICK**  
Moving joystick handle generates this JSON:  
```json
{
  "id": "the id you specified",
  "type": "JOYSTICK",
  "x": 0.71150637,
  "y": -0.13367589
}
```
For **Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth LE** : `<id>,JOYSTICK,<x>,<y>`

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd3b1b14-d1c5-42d5-8813-f01745856191" width="150" height="150">

_Note : Joystick is not rotatable in the Builder Screen_

The values of x and y range:
 - From -1.0 to 1.0 for both axes.
 - Positive x values indicate movement to the right, and negative values indicate movement to the left.
 - Positive y values indicate upward movement, and negative values indicate downward movement.    

### **SLIDER**  
Dragging the slider thumb generates the following JSON:  
```json
{
  "id": "the id you specified",
  "type": "SLIDER",
  "value": 1.4
}
```
For **Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth LE** connections, dragging the slider thumb generates a `CSV` message in the format: `<id>,SLIDER,<value>`.

- The `value` field represents the current position of the slider.  
- The value is always within the range of the minimum and maximum values specified during the slider's configuration.  

---

### **LED**
To update the LED, send the following JSON message to the app:
```json
{
  "id": "the id you specified",
  "type": "LED",
  "state": "ON"
}
```
- `state` accepts the following values:

  - `"ON"` – Turns the LED on
  - `"OFF"` – Turns the LED off
  - `"BLINK"` – Makes the LED blink

### **GAUGE**
To update the Gauge, send the following JSON message to the app::
```json
{
  "id": "the id you specified",
  "type": "GAUGE",
  "value": 120
}
```
- `value` is a number input used to update the gauge reading (such as speed, temperature, or progress).

### **LOG**

Each control pad includes an associated log terminal that displays logs sent from your script.  
When you click the **list icon** on the control pad, a bottom sheet will appear showing these logs.

To send a log message from your script, use the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "type": "LOG",
  "message": "hello world"
}
```

## Sending JSON Messages to DroidPad

You can send JSON messages to DroidPad to update the UI. All connection types are supported except for **BLE**. You can update following component

- SWITCH
- SLIDER
- LED
- GAUGE

To update a **SWITCH**, **SLIDER**, **LED**, or **GAUGE** send a JSON object message similar to the ones specified in the [SWITCH](#switch), [SLIDER](#slider), [LED](#led), [GAUGE](#gauge) sections, with the desired value or state.

For **Bluetooth Classic** and **TCP** connections, you must send each JSON message on a new line. This is because DroidPad reads the incoming stream line by line. Each JSON message should be on a single line, and multiple messages should be separated by a line feed (`\n`).

For example:

```
{"id":"s1","type":"SLIDER","value":1.4}\n{"id":"s1","type":"SLIDER","value":1.5}\n{"id":"s1","type":"SLIDER","value":1.4}
```

For **MQTT**, **WebSocket**, and **UDP** connections, you can send formatted JSON without the one-line and line feed restrictions, as these are message-based protocols. For **MQTT** you have to publish to `DroidPad/feed` topic


## MIDI

With the **MIDI** connection type a control pad drives a DAW, a synth or any
other MIDI destination directly. Interactions are sent as MIDI 1.0 channel
voice messages instead of JSON or CSV, so nothing has to translate them on the
other side.

### Attaching a device

DroidPad lists every MIDI destination the phone exposes:

- **Your computer**. Plug the phone in with a USB cable and set its USB mode to
  **MIDI** (tap the *Charging this device via USB* notification, or
  Settings -> Connected devices -> USB). The phone then shows up as a MIDI
  input on the computer, and in DroidPad's own device list, usually named
  `Android USB Peripheral Port`.
- **A USB instrument**. Attach a synth, a sound module or another MIDI device
  with an OTG cable and it appears under its own name.
- **Another app** on the phone that publishes a virtual MIDI port, such as a
  softsynth.

Then tap **Settings**, choose the **MIDI** connection type, pick the device, and
assign a message to each control.

### Mapping controls

Every control of the pad gets its own row in the mapping editor. Most
components are a single row; a **DPAD** expands into four (one per direction)
and a **JOYSTICK** into two (one per axis):

| Component | Rows |
|---|---|
| BUTTON, SWITCH, SLIDER, STEP SLIDER, STEERING WHEEL, LED, GAUGE | `<id>` |
| DPAD | `<id>.UP`, `<id>.DOWN`, `<id>.LEFT`, `<id>.RIGHT` |
| JOYSTICK | `<id>.X`, `<id>.Y` |

A fresh MIDI config is filled in for you: continuous controls get consecutive
controller numbers starting at CC 1, and on/off ones consecutive notes starting
at note 36. A control added later takes the lowest number nothing else is
using. **Reset Mappings** returns to the plain consecutive layout.

The table is stored with the connection, so a control added in the builder has
no mapping until you open **Settings** and save. Until then it sends nothing.

Each row picks a message type, a channel (1-16) and a number (0-127):

| Message | On/off control (BUTTON, SWITCH, DPAD) | Continuous control (SLIDER, STEERING WHEEL, JOYSTICK) |
|---|---|---|
| `NONE` | nothing is sent | nothing is sent |
| `NOTE` | note on at velocity 127 when pressed, note off when released | note on whose velocity follows the control |
| `CONTROL_CHANGE` | value 127 when pressed, 0 when released | value follows the control |
| `PROGRAM_CHANGE` | the configured program when pressed, nothing on release | the program number follows the control |
| `PITCH_BEND` | full bend when pressed, center when released | bend follows the control |

A tap on a button or a DPAD direction (**CLICK**) sends the pressed message
immediately followed by the released one.

### How values are scaled

Continuous controls are scaled from their own range onto the full MIDI range,
0-127 for notes, controllers and programs, 0-16383 for pitch bend:

- a **SLIDER** or **STEP SLIDER** uses the minimum and maximum you configured on it
- a **STEERING WHEEL** uses `-maxAngle` to `+maxAngle`, so a centered wheel sits at the middle
- a **JOYSTICK** axis uses -1.0 to 1.0, so a centered stick sits at the middle

Values outside the range are clamped.

### Updating the control pad from MIDI

MIDI runs both ways. Whatever number drives a control outward is the number
that drives it inward, so the same mapping table is used in reverse. The
components a script can update over the other connection types -- **SWITCH**,
**SLIDER**, **LED** and **GAUGE** -- can also be driven by sending MIDI to
DroidPad:

| Component | What an incoming message does |
|---|---|
| `GAUGE`, `SLIDER` | the value is scaled into the range configured on the item |
| `SWITCH` | a note on, or a value of 64 or more, switches it on; a note off, or a value below 64, switches it off |
| `LED` | the value picks a state: 0-42 **OFF**, 43-84 **ON**, 85-127 **BLINK** |

A note on at velocity zero counts as a note off, and a pitch bend spans the
same range over its 14 bits.

To blink the LED mapped to CC 5 on channel 1, send it 127:

```shell
amidi -p hw:1,0,0 -S "B0 05 7F"
```

`e2e/drive_midi_feedback.py` does the same continuously, ramping a gauge and
cycling an LED, which is a quick way to confirm a mapping end to end.

### Notes

- Buttons, DPADs, joysticks and steering wheels are send only, matching what a
  script can already update over the other connection types.
- Attached sensors have no MIDI representation and are not sent.
- Sharing a control pad by QR code or JSON file carries the mappings but not
  the selected device, since device names are specific to a phone.

## Important Note for Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy  
A long Bluetooth device name can cause advertisement failure (In case of BLE). To avoid this issue, use a shorter name. In your device's Bluetooth settings, change the Bluetooth device name to five or fewer characters, such as `dev`.

For devices running **Android 12 or higher**, you also need to ensure that your app has the necessary Bluetooth permissions. To do this, go to the app's system settings and grant the required **Nearby Devices** permission. Without this permission, the app won't be able to advertise Bluetooth LE services or access paired devices when using Bluetooth Classic.

## ⚠️ Limitations of Control Pad Sharing via QRCode and Json file
Although DroidPad allows you to share your control pads via QR code and JSON file, this feature has certain limitations. The app does not implement a grid system for item placement; instead, all items are positioned relative to the origin point at the top-left corner (0,0) of the control pad. As a result, when you import a control pad onto a device with a different screen size, DroidPad applies an offset shift to all items to adapt them to the new dimensions. In some cases, this automatic adjustment may require manual fine-tuning by the user importing it
